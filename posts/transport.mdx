Even though the title says Toronto transport, we are going to cover some of the services within the GTA (Greater Toronto Area). And when it says public transport it means all three ways: subway, streetcar and bus.

## Essential Map of Toronto 

If you are in Toronto, there is a very slim chance that you will live your life entirely inside the city. You will need to know about the local transit system of the surrounding areas to navigate better. Here is a list of major cities near Toronto in the GTA.

* 1.Mississuaga 
* 2.Bramptom 
* 3.Markham
* 4.Scarborough
* 5.Etobicoke
* 6.North York

Once you get a ticket for one ride you get a 2 hours validity on the ticket. You can hop on and hop off any number of times on any of the TTC transit means and you will not be charged within this time. This is similar to the system in New York. You get 4 hour validity for each ticket in the country.

Apart from these ares, there is a dedicated transport service for Hamilton, Milton, Burlington, Oakville etc, but these are not as important as the above.
