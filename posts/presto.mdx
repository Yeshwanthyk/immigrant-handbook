If there was one thing that went as planned, it would be hour our flight landed in Toronto. Our flight (Qatar Airways) got us on time to the Toronto Pearson Airport. Yes, that was the only thing.

We waited for our turn at the immigration area with our documents handy just like every one else in the line. Seemingly at least 40% of the people around us were fellow immigrant couples. Most of us had something of an exhausted but excited face. We got to practice patience for about 30 minutes. When it was our turn, we did everything we were asked to do at the counter. Now, in order to mail our PR (permanent resident) cards, the officer needed an address in Toronto. We were ready with one and handed it to him.

    The immigration officer will ask you for an address in Canada to which they can mail your PR card to you. Most of us do not have family here, that does not mean you can give the address of an acquaintance. PR card is the most important document the government will give you and you need to prove that it will reach your hands safely. The officer asks you enough questions to understand what kind of address you are giving him, so make sure you tell him if you do not have a long term accommodation yet. They will ask you to complete the process online once you have an address you can call your own. Don't worry if you do not have an arrangement.

Turns out we did not get full disclosure on how to navigate through the questions after this. The officer asked us our relationship with the person living in the address. We told in chorus that it was of a "family-friend". He went ahead and scarped the paper with the address. We did not expect this to happen, so we waited for him to explain what happens next. He told us that he required an address of that was of family only. He told us he cannot complete the process here and we will have to fill our form online. We were asked to give an address in the form once we find long term accommodation. With this epic face-palm moment, we moved on with our passports stamped. Next to the immigration area, there was a counter for new commer services, they handed us a big red carry bag with gazillion broachers on facilities for new immigrants in Toronto. I was thrilled to go over them because I love broachers, its unexplainable. There is nothing in these booklets that you will not find online so feel free to scrap them once you're done browsing.

Next we moved towards the baggage area, where all our bags were picked up and left around the belt because of the delays in immigration. We spotted our 4 large suitcases easily because we wrapped their handles in a neon colored ribbon that makes them stand out. We found a spot near the exit and checked our shuttle status. We spotted our cab outside with the license plate number and hopped on.
